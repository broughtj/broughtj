# **Bayes**

> *The people who don't know they are Bayesian are called non-Bayesian.* -- I.J. Good


# **Uncertainty**

> *Some 15 billion years ago, as best we can tell, we were a dense mass of exploding gasses. Today we are as we find ourselves, evolved into our present state of partially informed being and knowing, but uncertain precisely about all we have been, and uncertain about what we will become. One thing we can be sure of is that there has been no repeatability of stable conditions that provides a real base for "the primitive notion of probability" as something outside of ourselves. Probability is nothing other than the logic of our uncertain judgements about the world. For the statistical community to pretend that as a primitive notion it provides a method for making objective inferences about the world would be both a lie and a shame.* -- Frank Lad

> _A market is not competitive by assumption or by_ ___construction___. _A market_ ___becomes___ _competitive, and competitive rules_ ___comes to be___ _established as institutions emerge to place limits on individual behavior patterns. It is this_ ___becoming___ _process, brought about by the continuous pressure of human behavior in exchange, that is the central part of our discipline, if we have one, not the dry-rot of postulated perfection. A solution to a general-equilibrium set of equations is not predetermined by exogenously-determined rules. A general solution, if there is one,_ ___emerges___ _as a result of a whole network of evolving exchanges, bargains, trades, side payments, agreements, contracts which, finally at some point, ceases to renew itself. At each stage in this evolution towards solution, there are_ ___gains___ _to be made, there are exchanges possible, and this being true, the direction of movement is modified._ -- James M. Buchanan
